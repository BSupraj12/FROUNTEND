              <h5 class="card-title">Trading Website</h5>
              <p class="card-text">In Visual Studio, I spearheaded the development of a dynamic website dedicated to electronic device trading, employing a stack comprising HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MongoDB. Crafting an intuitive front-end UI, I meticulously designed interactive features using JavaScript to enhance user engagement. Leveraging MongoDB for robust backend functionality, I ensured secure storage of user data and transaction details. Collaborating seamlessly with team members, I adeptly troubleshooted issues and optimized the website for performance. The successful launch of the platform marked a significant milestone, facilitating seamless transactions between users and underscoring my proficiency in web development.</p>

              <p class="card-text">The "Live Speech Portraits: Real-Time Photorealistic Talking-Head Animation" project represents a significant stride in audio-driven facial animation, blending techniques from speech representation learning, head pose estimation, and facial reenactment to create realistic animations from audio streams. This research, building on decades of work within the computer graphics community, employs both video-based editing and image-based generation methods to produce photorealistic animations. Utilizing advanced neural networks, such as LSTM and GRU for dynamic feature extraction from audio, the project innovates by generating animations that accurately reflect a person's specific talking style through deep learning models. This approach not only overcomes limitations of previous methods, such as dependency on existing video lengths or challenges with unseen faces but also enhances realism by predicting head and upper body movements that align with audio inputs. By focusing on end-to-end training and leveraging adversarial learning through GANs, "Live Speech Portraits" pushes the boundaries of generating talking-head videos from a single or a few reference images, achieving real-time, high-fidelity animations that could transform how we interact with digital media.</p>
